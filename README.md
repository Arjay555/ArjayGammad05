ðŸŒŸ Elemental Duel: The Wives of the King ðŸŒŸ

Game Overview

Elemental Duel: The Wives of the King is an interactive text-based battle game where you take on the role of one of the six powerful historical figures, each with unique elemental powers. You'll face off against a series of enemies, from sorcerers to deities, and use your character's abilities to battle for victory.

How to Play?

1. Choose Your Character
   At the start of the game, you can either:
   -Choose your own character: Select from the six wives of King Henry VIII (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, Catherine Parr).
   -Let fate decide: The game will randomly select a character for you.

2. Battle Mechanics
   Once your character is chosen, youâ€™ll face a random enemy from a list that includes sorcerers, wizards, and other magical foes. During each round of combat:
   -Character Powers: Your character has five different powers, each with unique effects. Some powers are used to attack, while others can heal or buff your character.
   -Resource Management: You have two primary resources to manage: 
     -HP (Health Points): Your life force. If your HP reaches zero, you lose the battle.
     -MP (Mana Points): The resource used to activate your powers. If you don't have enough MP, you cannot use certain abilities.
   -Enemy Actions: The enemy will also attack you, reducing your HP each turn.

3. Turn-Based Combat
   -Choose Your Action: At the beginning of each turn, you'll be presented with a list of your characterâ€™s powers. Each power has a cost (MP) and an effect (either damage or healing).
   -Enemy Attacks: After you make your move, the enemy will retaliate with a random attack, reducing your HP.
   -Escape Option: If you're losing the battle, you can choose to escape by selecting "0" when prompted to choose your action. This ends the battle but doesn't guarantee success.

4. Victory or Defeat
   -Victory: You win the battle by reducing the enemyâ€™s HP to zero. The game will then declare you the victor and offer the option to continue or exit.
   -Defeat: If your HP reaches zero, the enemy wins the battle and you lose.

5. Resource Recovery
   -Each round, your MP increases by a small amount (5 MP), so you can gradually regain enough MP for your next move.
   -Healing: Some powers allow you to heal yourself, restoring HP and helping you survive longer battles.
